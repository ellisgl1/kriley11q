DFF-1.3.0 summary:

Features:
---------

  User Interfaces:
  ----------------

* Node browser : 
        - The browser now is UTF-8 aware, so it mean that character of file name and directory will be readable
in any languages. 
        - You can use the arrow icon near the filename to display the content of a directory and is subdirectory (recursively).
        - You can now tag  
        - You can now filter nodes
        - The menu of the search panel was entirely renewed it's much more easy to use now
        - You can now easily create attribute list and dynamically change column
        - Video have thumbnail
        - A blue icon with a blue '+' now appear on top of node who created child (Have a module applyied on it).
        - A new icon who look like a 'link' now appear on top of node who is a VFS link to an other node. You can double-click on it to be redirected to the linked node.
        - A new root icon called "modules root" give short to all node who have created child.
        - A new check box system is in place to select files you want to bookmark or do an other operations on it. You can also use the right button menu to select/deselect your choices.

* batch : Now DFF shell command in batch must preceed by : ! , other command will be interepret as python code. So you can merge DFF command and python in a batch script. Comment line starting with # will no be printed anymore as you can use the python print function directly. When using it with python think to launch DFF in '-d'debug mode ('-d') to have the output redirected.

* preview widget : You can now disable preview by clicking the check box on the top of the widget. This can fasten the browsing of file with the keyboard arow in the node browser as the preview menu didn't need to update each time a file is selected.
